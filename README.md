# Aranarth-Core

Hello!

This repository is used to track the development of the AranarthCore plugin, used as a basis to improve the "quality of life" in playing Minecraft on my SMP server, Aranarth.

The plugin contains many diverse features such as:
- Homepads that allow teleportation across the world and dimensions
- Automatic crop replanting
- Improved horse stats and abilities
- Reduced mob griefing
- Many custom recipes for items that previously were uncraftable
- Items are automatially picked up into shulker boxes that contain them
- Much more!

The plugin has been developed specifically for how we would like to use it, therefore there are multiple values that have been hardcoded in.

Now let's get back to playing!
