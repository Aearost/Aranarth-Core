# Aranarth-Core

Hello!

This repository is used to track the development of the AranarthCore plugin, used as a basis to improve the "quality of life" in playing Minecraft on my server, Aranarth.

The plugin contains many diverse features such as:
- Custom weather and calendar system
- Custom land claiming system
- Custom Avatar system
- In-game and donor rank systems
- Server staff commands for player management
- Integration with Discord
- Enhanced potion functionality
- Quiver to store various types of arrows
- Many custom recipes for items that previously were un-craftable
- Enhanced shulker box functionality
- Automatic compression of items
- Much more!

The plugin has been catered to the server, therefore there are multiple values that have been hardcoded in.

Now let's get back to playing!
